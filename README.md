ABSTRACTION
- The data structures follows abstractions, specified in the abstract_<name>.hpp file located in each data structure.

- Algorithms directory contains a bunch of famous Enumerative and Selective classic problem such as:
	° String matching problem solved using Backtracking (KMP Algorithm)
	° Knapsack problem, solved both using Backtracking and Greedy approach.
	° 

- others direcory contains 2 files:
   - main.cpp is used for testing the data-structures and algorithms
   - functions.hpp contains functions and algorithms/execises solved for the respective data-structure the directory's file is into.
