# Project Overview

## Abstraction
The data structures follow specific abstractions, defined in the `abstract_<name>.hpp` file located within each data structure's directory.

## Algorithms
The `algorithms` directory contains several well-known selective and generative classic problems, including:

- **String Matching Problem**: Solved using Backtracking (KMP Algorithm).
- **Knapsack Problem**: Implemented with both Backtracking and Greedy approaches.
- **Simultaneous Min & Max Search**: Uses a Divide-and-Conquer approach.
- **N-Queens Problem**: Solved using Backtracking.
- **Partition Problem**: Solved using an enumerative approach.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Includes Merge Sort and Quick Sort.

## File Structure
- The `others` directory contains two files:
  - `main.cpp`: Used for testing data structures and algorithms.
  - `functions.hpp`: Contains utility functions and exercises related to the respective data structure within the directory.

## Notes
This project was designed for educational purposes only. I do not guarantee that all operations work flawlessly; some errors may be present and can be easily fixed. The code could be improved in terms of security and elegance. Additionally, some comments may contain grammatical errors.
